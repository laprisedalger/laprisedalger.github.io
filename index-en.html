      <h2 id=preamble>Preamble</h2>
      <p><span class=newthought>France's colonial history</span> has long been concealed by its successive governments. These have consistently denied the crimes committed through colonization, in the face of certain countries, like Algeria, which demanded recognition of these crimes to bring peace to hearts. Nevertheless, some recent positive declarations from certain French leaders, as well as some revelations made through television documentaries in France, have had the merit of opening up a debate on this highly sensitive issue.</p>
      <p>However, the French population, too long fed a distorted history of Algeria's colonization, both through school education and through certain media and political discourse, consequently remains convinced of the preponderance of its benefits. Thus, in a poll recently launched by the French newspaper Le Figaro, it seems more than 85% of voters—with over 197,000 participants—were opposed to official apologies from France for its colonial past.</p>
      <p>It would be interesting to ask these 85% of voters to reconsider their opinion after taking the time to read the following work and informing themselves by viewing the astonishing documentaries about this colonial history, recently broadcast by a French state channel.</p>
      <p>Regarding this work, I would like to clarify that I do not claim to be a historian but have simply wanted to transmit, to those who wish it, the knowledge I have been able to draw from my readings of various articles and historical works concerning this aspect of Algeria's history.</p>

      <h2 id=algeria-before-the-arrival-of-the-french>Algeria Before the Arrival of the French</h2>
      <p>French troops landed at Sidi Ferruch beach on June 14, 1830, to seize the Regency of Algiers. These troops knew nothing of this country except what they had been told. What was this country really like?</p>
      <p>What was called the Regency or Kingdom of Algiers was a state whose extent roughly corresponded to present-day Algeria and which had been under Ottoman Empire tutelage since the arrival of the Barbarossa brothers in 1515 and governed by a Dey appointed by Istanbul. The Dey's power relied on corsairs at sea and Janissary militias in the city. This state was recognized by most Western countries, which had moreover established diplomatic representations there.</p>
      <p>The Regency of Algiers was divided into four provinces or Beyliks, each administered by a Bey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The Central Beylik, corresponding to the Algiers region and Mitidja, constituting the Sultan's territory, Dey Hussein at this period.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Beylik of Constantine, to the east, led by Bey Hadj Ahmed, a just and respected man.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Beylik of Titteri with Médéa as its capital, governed by Bey Boumezrag.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Beylik of Oran, with little influence.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Algeria then presented itself as the vastest, most fertile, and best cultivated country in the North African region.</p>
      <p>In the center, its capital Algiers is dominated by the imposing Casbah; this is inhabited essentially by natives and houses numerous craft shops and workshops and is surrounded by numerous villas and gardens intended for notables and foreign diplomats.</p>
      <p>The country's interior, very vast, houses 9/10<sup>ths</sup> of the population, organized in tribes, sometimes very powerful, on a relatively autonomous management mode. This population is distributed in countless villages, most of which are surrounded by well-tended gardens, orchards, and olive forests. Activity is based on raising immense herds and cultivating cereals, which cover great plains.</p>
      <p>Claude Ambroise Fernel testifies: "This land, which had been presented to us as savage and uninhabited, offered us on the contrary the most picturesque and varied spectacle. It is covered with pretty country houses surrounded by gardens; all are built on heights whose undulating movements contrast completely with the aridity and broken forms of the Provence coasts. The vegetation is superb, and everywhere springs and water currents fertilize the earth. Fruits are in abundance"<label for=sm-1

          class=sidenote>Campaign of Africa in 1830, ed. Barrois and Duprat, 1831, p. 25</span>.</p>
      <p>The people are cultured and all Algerians knew how to read and write, as reported both by Hamdan Khodja in his book, The Mirror, and by the French themselves; indeed, this was written by the French commission of inquiry of 1833 on the state of the Regency and confirmed by Lieutenant-Colonel Claude-Antoine Rozet: "The Moorish people, taken in general, perhaps have more education than the French people, almost all men know how to read, write and count a little; there are a great number of public schools in the regency of Algiers, where children are instructed from the age of four"<label for=sm-2

          class=sidenote>Journey in the regency of Algiers, ed. Arthus Bertrand, 1833</span>.</p>
      <p>In fact, in 1830, the country had:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>More than 100 primary schools in Algiers, 86 in Constantine and 50 in Tlemcen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Between 6 and 7 secondary colleges respectively in Algiers and Constantine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>More than 10 universities, in the form of Zaouias, distributed throughout the country.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Regency's administration, relying only on the Turks, totally neglected the indigenous population and was only interested in them for tax collection, which became increasingly heavy and a source of nascent revolts, as well as to draw fighters when necessary, particularly the cavalry corps, proud of a long reputation for bravery.</p>

      <h2 id=the-causes-and-reasons-for-the-french-expedition>The Causes and Reasons for the French Expedition</h2>
      <p>This French expedition, meticulously prepared to seize Algiers, was gigantic, composed of a powerful, disciplined army and enormous logistics, all embarked on a fleet of several hundred ships.</p>
      <p>Why such an expedition? For reasons of honor and to wash away an affront, the French government had then affirmed, but in reality, other unspoken greedy objectives were the true reasons.</p>
      <p>To understand these reasons, we must go back in time, specifically to April 29, 1827, the last day of Ramadan and the eve of Eid al-Fitr in Algiers. On this day, a ceremony was organized in Dey Hussein's palace to which all accredited diplomats were invited. Among them, the French consul Pierre Deval, usually arrogant, distinguished himself that day by contemptuous and provocative behavior. To a question posed by the Dey regarding a still unpaid French debt relating to a wheat delivery by Algeria, this consul gave an insolent response, close to offense; pushed to the limit and very angry, the Dey brushed his face with two or three strokes of his fan and ordered him to leave the premises. This was the perfect pretext for the French government to go to war and "wash away the affront" that had just been done to it by this gesture, which has since become famous.</p>
      <p>Better still, this war would allegedly be undertaken in the name of Christianity, which promised to go "punish these barbarian pirates" who scoured the Mediterranean and, at the same time, deliver their numerous Christian prisoners.</p>
      <p>In reality, these were only fallacious pretexts because it is clearly inconceivable that one would decide to launch such a large military expedition, very expensive and hazardous, for a reason that could easily be resolved through diplomatic channels. Moreover, while it was true that in previous decades, the corsairs of Algiers (and not pirates) were masters of the Mediterranean, this was no longer the case since the destruction of the Algerian fleet by the English navy about ten years earlier, and there was practically no more privateering or prisoners in Algiers.</p>
      <p>On the contrary, and the height of hypocrisy, French ships still practiced the slave trade in the Atlantic from West Africa, and moreover, France still practiced slavery in its Caribbean island colonies until 1848, the year of its abolition. Note moreover that there again, the height of contempt, compensation was granted to the owners while the former slaves had no right to any reparation.</p>
      <p>The real reasons for this warlike adventure were therefore to be sought elsewhere, and we must go back in time again to fully grasp them.</p>

          class=margin-toggle><span class=marginnote>Figure 1: Chronology of power in France.</span> <img
          src=images/chrono.png alt="Chronology of power in France."> </figure>
      <p>Let us go back in time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>First, to the period before 1815, in the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, who had marked this slice of history with his numerous military campaigns in Europe and the Middle East. For the needs of these campaigns, Napoleon had become heavily indebted to Algeria by supplying himself with wheat. After years of great victories, the fall came in 1815, at the Battle of Waterloo, with a definitive defeat against a European coalition, followed by his exile to Saint Helena Island.</p>
          <p>At the end of this period, France, which operated on a war economy mode, found itself in a disastrous socio-economic situation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Then, after the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815, the French Senate restored the monarchy and successively placed on the throne Louis XVIII then Charles X, who would reign until 1830. During this new period, France continued to struggle with multiple problems, with agriculture in decline, significant industrial lag, particularly against its rival across the Channel, and a large debt to Algeria, which Napoleon had been unable to honor and which had ended up degenerating into a commercial and diplomatic conflict. Despite some reforms by Louis XVIII, the situation had worsened under Charles X, whose end of reign was marked by popular discontent and a conflict with the opposition that was growing crescendo, opposition that clearly risked winning the approaching parliamentary elections, thus putting the throne in peril.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It was therefore under Charles X that the fan incident occurred in 1827, an incident followed by a declaration of war by France and a maritime blockade of the city of Algiers. However, nothing had been undertaken immediately and it was only two years later, in 1829, that Charles X, under pressure from the Prince de Polignac, whom he had just appointed as council president, accelerated the decision to conquer Algiers, for the invoked facade reasons.</p>
      <p>In reality, the true, unspoken reasons were multiple and essentially centered on coveting the famous Regency treasure; this treasure stored in the Dey's palace, which made the chancelleries in Algiers fantasize and which, once seized, would have, according to predictions, allowed achieving several objectives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Replenish the French state coffers, be financially able to corrupt the imminent parliamentary elections to counter the threatening opposition candidacies and thus obtain a majority that would allow Charles X to preserve his throne.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Finally get rid of the recurring and thorny question of debt repayment to Algeria.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Divert the French from social and political problems by flattering national pride.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Finally accomplish the long unfulfilled dream of restoring the faltering prestige of the royal family and repositioning politically vis-à-vis the rival neighbor, England.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Furthermore, it would not be superfluous to emphasize the harmful role of three characters, belonging to a circle close to power, accomplices with consul Pierre Deval in the deterioration of relations between France and Algeria with this dark debt affair.</p>
      <p>These characters were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand first: former bishop, cunning, corrupt and libertine diplomat, nicknamed the "diplomatic devil." Bonaparte's man, then appointed head of government by Louis XVIII in 1815, he is also the man of betrayals and plots.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The merchants Joseph Cohen Bacri and Michel Busnach. Established in Algiers, they had started with only a small shop then quickly enriched themselves by speculating on the backs of naive Algerians. Scheming and sneaky, they had managed to position themselves as intermediaries in wheat transactions between Algeria and France since Napoleon's time, then schemed with Talleyrand to pocket part of the debt without paying anything back to the Dey.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We must also recall the predatory acts of the House of Seillière. For the needs of the imminent expedition, De Bourmont, who had full powers, had chosen to grant this House, under conditions deemed dubious, the immense market for supplying and transporting the armada. Later in Algiers, the growing influence of the Seillières would allow them to draw other significant profits through speculative transactions on confiscated Algerian product stocks, then to convoy on their ships part of the diverted Casbah treasure.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id=sec:the_expedition>The Expedition</h2>
      <p>The expedition was thus decided. It remained to define the strategy that would allow invading the territory with the least risk because Algiers was reputed to be impregnable and had in the past been able to repel multiple landing attempts, whether French, English, Dutch or others. The most notable attempt was that of the King of Spain, Charles V, who in 1541 had suffered a heavy defeat and had to retreat with enormous losses in men and ships, faced with local resistance and unexpectedly very unfavorable climatic conditions. Algiers was moreover called by its inhabitants "El Djazair el mahroussa" (the well-guarded).</p>
      <p>The sought strategy had in fact already been developed twenty years earlier, in 1808, when Napoleon, who was already planning to conquer Algeria and the Maghreb, had sent a spy officer there, Vincent Yves Boutin; under cover of a friendly visit, he crisscrossed the Algiers coastline for about two months, then managed to establish a precise cartography of Algiers as well as a detailed reconnaissance of the city's defense means. He drew conclusions which he wrote and which can be summarized as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The frontal attack by sea was to be ruled out due to effective defense positions and also due to the harmful experience of multiple previous attempts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A distance landing seemed more judicious, consisting of bypassing the city of Algiers by land and taking it from behind. The landing site is even specified, at Sidi Ferruch, then to advance towards Staouéli, then Sidi Khalef, arrive on the heights of Fort l'Empereur<label for=sm-3
              class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox id=sm-3 class=margin-toggle><span
              class=sidenote>Fort l'Empereur, or "Sultan Kallassi," or "Kalaa Si" for the Turks, is a fortification built on the heights of Algiers, between El Biar and the Casbah which it overlooks and which it is supposed to defend. Its name refers to Emperor Charles V, who had established a first camp there at the beginning of his adventure in 1541, before the disaster and retreat in disorder.</span>, which would have to be taken, to finally enter Algiers from behind, the weak point of its defenses.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus, Charles X and Polignac simply had to adopt and apply these recommendations.</p>
      <p>The expedition was therefore undertaken and command had been entrusted to General Louis de Bourmont. This choice was surprising because this officer, highly criticized by the opposition in France, carried a dishonorable reputation, tainted by a serious act of desertion during the Battle of Waterloo, on the eve of which he had surrendered to the enemy, to whom he had even revealed Napoleon's battle plans and would thus have contributed to the defeat of the French army.</p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id=sec:the_landing>The Landing</h2>
      <p>Departing from Toulon, under the command of General De Bourmont, assisted by Generals Loverdo, Berthezène and Duke des Cars, the immense fleet, led by Admiral Duperré, landed, according to established plans, at Sidi Ferruch beach on June 14, 1830.</p>
      <p>It was composed of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>More than 100 well-armed warships.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>675 transport boats (for troops, armaments, engineers, tents, livestock, horses, drinks...)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A total of about 37,000 men, including soldiers, sailors and personnel. A structured army, well supervised by generals and career officers, composed of men seasoned by Napoleon Bonaparte's previous military campaigns, comprising three infantry divisions.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Facing them, Dey Hussein, unconcerned and underestimating the enemy forces, sent to meet them an army composed of Janissaries, cavalry and Algerian troops from different regions of the country. It was commanded by Agha Ibrahim, the Dey's son-in-law, an incompetent man, unaware of the real situation and sure of his victory.</p>
      <p>The first confrontation took place on June 19 at Staouéli where the Agha had established his camp, five days after the French arrival, when he could have attacked earlier, as his entourage had advised him, and thus taken advantage of the landing process before the enemy army organized itself. Finally, the battle was fierce but quickly won by the French army, more disciplined and whose rifles and cannons wreaked havoc within a heterogeneous army, insufficiently prepared and led by a man little versed in the military strategies of land battles.</p>
      <p>The Agha's army then had to fall back to the village of Sidi Khalef where De Bourmont's army joined them five days later, to defeat them again and then arrive facing Fort l'Empereur. At this level, the battle turned into a siege, with an important artillery duel. There again, the French cannons, more powerful and more precise, overcame the fortress's resistance, which was finally taken on July 4. No obstacle now stood before the French army, which entered Algiers through the Casbah and obtained the Dey's capitulation on July 5, 1830.</p>
      <p>Charles X exulted then celebrated with pomp this victory that he did not think would come so easily, while waiting to pocket for his personal account part of this treasure. But, vicissitudes of history, the situation in Paris had become so poisoned that it ended up leading to the July Revolution which resulted in his arrest. He would therefore not benefit from the Algiers expedition, from which he expected much. It was otherwise and he found himself exiled in England.</p>
      <p>He was replaced on the throne by Louis Philippe, who would reign over France for another 18 years.</p>
      <p>The victory in Algiers having become total, the senior officers set about searching for the famous Regency treasure, which had been amassed throughout the Ottoman reign over Algiers. The key to the cache was given to them by the "Khaznadji" himself (the finance minister and treasurer). The loot found well deserved the fantasies it aroused. There was everything: tons of gold ingots, large quantities of gold and silver coins, jewelry, precious stones...</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id=sec:the_embezzlement_of_the_treasure>The Embezzlement of the Treasure</h2>
      <p>De Bourmont, whose mission was to seize Algiers, also had a secret mission to embezzle a large part of the confiscated treasure. He designated, for form's sake, a finance commission that was to take possession of the loot and inventory it. This commission, composed of Baron Denniée, the army's chief intendant, Jean-Baptiste Firino, the army's paymaster general, and Henri-Alexis de Tolozé, member of the general staff, would make its report and conclude that the value of the treasure amounted to nearly 49 million francs of the time. It was of course a fraudulent report since it was worth at least 10 times more according to later estimates. This undervaluation was in fact quite intentional and carried out with a view to carrying out massive embezzlement.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, frenzy had seized the soldiers who undertook to sack the city. According to the testimony of General Loverdo, disgusted, the young officers, although bearers of illustrious names, "led the pack to the kill" and basely participated in the looting. Then came the great feast, where all those who had access to the treasure, directly or indirectly, helped themselves abundantly.</p>
      <p>From there, history would remain marked by two major facts: first, the hold-up carried out on the Algiers treasure as well as the scandal of what would become of it, and the second relates to the limitless massacres perpetrated against the Algerian population, all under the cover of the infamous perjury committed by the French military command and which seriously tarnished the honor of the King of France.</p>
      <p>Indeed, during the expedition, De Bourmont had written three successive proclamations to the attention of the Algerians, which he distributed to them in the name of the King of France and in which he swore "by his blood" that this expedition had no purpose but to drive out the Dey and free the Algerians from Turkish tyranny. Moreover, he committed to respecting all their property, their properties as well as their mosques and their "holy religion." This was of course only a sordid, premeditated ruse, but which the Algerians believed and subsequently offered no resistance to the entry of French troops into Algiers after the capture of Fort l'Empereur. They believed it naively, on the one hand because these promises emanated from a "civilized nation" and engaged the word of a king and on the other hand because, for their part, they had an almost sacred conception of the given word. This felony would ultimately reveal a nation then imbued with hypocrisy and greed.</p>
      <p>Finally, while the 49 million francs would be sent to France and considered largely sufficient to reimburse the expedition costs, pay the military and pay the rest to the French Treasury, numerous other boats, some belonging to the House of Seillière, loaded with crates removed from the Algiers treasure, headed for different ports in France, Sardinia, Spain and especially England where the embezzled riches would subsequently be recycled in opaque international banking circuits, to finally fall into the pockets of Louis Philippe and those of government personalities, politicians, military personnel as well as bankers, the indispensable laundering agents of the loot.</p>
      <p>In fact, these individuals suddenly found themselves at the head of a fortune, sometimes immense, specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The members of the finance commission: Denniée, Firino and Tholozé, whose lifestyle suddenly found itself metamorphosed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Bacris and Busnachs: speculators and corruptors in league with power, they saw their wealth and influence propelled to the top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Seillières themselves and their associates Schneider, who having taken their share of the embezzled gold, could thus afford to acquire in France an old metallurgical center, the Creusot forges<label for=sm-4
              class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox id=sm-4 class=margin-toggle><span
              class=sidenote>It is an old metallurgical center, located in Saône-et-Loire, which after some setbacks, was closed in 1832. The partners Seillière and Schneider made a spectacular acquisition in 1836, made an enormous investment there and developed an important industrial activity oriented toward railways, automobiles, shipbuilding and armaments. At the same time the city became prosperous and would dominate the region by housing what would become one of the flagships of French industry. Such was the contribution of money stolen from Algiers to the development of France.</span>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In London, Talleyrand, Charles X and De Bourmont who would join them after his departure from Algiers, were not left out since they found themselves in possession of considerable sums and Charles X could have at Forbes bank unlimited credit, of mysterious origin. Part would, moreover, be used to conduct an armed political and insurrectional counter-offensive against the new power of Louis Philippe, however without success.</p>
      <p>In France, the rumor of looting spread quickly and became so strong that, under pressure, King Louis Philippe sent General Clauzel to Algiers, replacing De Bourmont, to conduct an investigation into these allegations. Clauzel then appointed a very controversial but effective character, Jean Baptiste Flandin, as head and rapporteur of the investigation commission. Meticulous and pugnacious, Flandin managed to find evidence indicating that the amount of the treasure actually amounted to 240 million francs, which reveals an embezzlement of 200 million. His report became explosive since it cited the names of high personalities in power. Clauzel then ordered the investigation to stop and made a declaration whitewashing the military and confirming the result of the initial finance commission.</p>
      <p>The story would not stop there since according to new later testimonies, both that of the Khaznadji, that of the English consul Saint-John, and also of other credible personalities, the real amount of the treasure is readjusted to about 500 million gold francs of the time, or the equivalent of 5 to 6 billion euros currently, therefore a huge embezzlement. Flandin, despite his sidelining and the harassment he would be subject to, would not give up and, with intact ferocity, would resurface at each political change, sometimes not disinterestedly, and would continue for more than 20 years to denounce the embezzlement, but in vain, until his death in 1853.</p>
      <p>After the looting of the treasure, another looting followed, more vast:</p>

      <h2 id=sec:the_massacres>The Massacres</h2>
      <p>In 1832, King Louis Philippe appointed René Savary, Duke of Rovigo as governor of Algiers. He was an odious military man who would mark his passage with cruel and criminal behavior, not hesitating to resort to summary executions and vast killings. In April 1832, envoys from a southern tribe, bearers of a message to the French, had been robbed near the territory where the El-Aouffia tribe was camped; Savary then sent a troop, which surprised at dawn the tribe still asleep under its tents and massacred it entirely, about 1,200 souls, savagely killed, without distinction of age or sex. Their dwellings were then destroyed and their herds confiscated. A few days later, it was learned that this tribe had nothing to do with what it was accused of. This was the first genocide in Algeria carried out in the name of civilized France.</p>
      <p>It was not the last and many others would follow, strongly supported by an extermination policy, whose architect was undoubtedly General Bugeaud. In 1840, the French government, until then hesitant, took the resolution to totally occupy Algeria and this by all means. To this effect, it appointed General Bugeaud governor of Algeria, with the mission to crush the revolt and occupy the country. From 1840 to 1847, this criminal general led the most murderous actions and exactions. Using the most abject methods, particularly in his war against Emir Abdelkader who was succeeding in building an organized and powerful state, Bugeaud undertook punitive expeditions against any tribe that supported him, resorting to the systematic massacre of men, women and children, followed by the destruction of their dwellings and the seizure of their livestock.</p>
      <p>In line with his logic, he extended this policy of terror to any tribe or village that did not submit to France's domination and undertook a real scorched earth policy, denying the Algerian people the right to defend themselves against a foreign invasion. Thus, at the slightest pretext, entire villages were razed, their orchards and crops destroyed, and their population displaced, in order to appropriate their ancestral lands, then to achieve a real replacement of the population, with new settlers constantly arriving, full of greed. He set about building fortified colonization villages and asked his soldiers to stay in Algeria as settlers, according to his motto "by the plow and by the sword."</p>
      <p>To justify these actions, reductive analyses were propagated, focusing on the "inability" of the Algerian to make profitable such a rich country and thereby justifying the "duty to dispossess him of it."</p>
      <p>The population displacement operations would be, in turn, devastating, sources of great famines and epidemics. The occurrence of these scourges, falsely attributed to nature, can in reality only be attributed to the military action that preceded them and which is directly responsible for them.</p>
      <p>The methods of extermination then diversified to take the form of the infamously famous "enfumades" (smoke-outs), horrible means of annihilating entire tribes who took refuge in caves to escape reprisals.</p>
      <p>Thus, the Ouled Riah tribe, which resisted the invasion of the French army and after a very hard battle, had at one point to flee from the enemy's advance and had taken refuge from June 18 to 20, 1845, in a vast cavern, the caves of Ghar El Frachih, located in the Dahra massif, east of Mostaganem. More than 1,000 people, composed of adults but also many elderly people, women and children, were packed there with their livestock that they had taken with them.</p>
      <p>A few days earlier, Bugeaud gave his instructions: "if these scoundrels retreat into their caves, imitate Cavaignac at Sbéhas; smoke them out completely, like foxes." The French army, commanded by Lieutenant Pelissier, executing General Bugeaud's recommendations, then undertook, after pseudo-summons, the sinister task of condemning the cave entrance with bundles and straw bales and setting fire to it, a fire maintained all night by the French troops, thus condemning to certain death those who had taken refuge there. A death that must have been slow and atrocious, in an atmosphere of panic due to darkness, smoke and asphyxiation and under the trampling by the livestock, also panicked. A nightmarish vision was subsequently offered to the soldiers, that of a horrible spectacle of shapeless heaps of flesh, burned and torn bodies, in an entanglement of human beings, oxen, donkeys and sheep. Pélissier had no remorse, "the skin of just one of my drummers was worth more than the lives of all these wretches," he said.</p>
      <p>Despite the indignation of the French press and some intellectuals, such as Honoré de Balzac, Pélissier received the fierce support of the Minister of War, Marshal Soult and that of Marshal Bugeaud, governor of Algeria, who, adding ignobility to cruelty, congratulated Pélissier for the success of the expedition and confirmed to him that if he had been reduced to this "cruel necessity," it was only by the "blind madness and fanaticism" of these insurgents, thus falsifying the course of the event by shifting responsibility for this criminal act onto the victim itself. Pélissier would later be rewarded for his services and would be appointed Marshal of France, then governor of Algeria in 1860 and Grand Knight of the Legion of Honor.</p>
      <p>These unpunished smoke-outs would be repeated and a few months later, on August 8, 1845, Saint-Arnaud used the same method to wall up 500 Algerians alive sheltered in a cave at Ain Mérane, between Ténès and Mostaganem then set fire to the entrance.</p>
      <p>Cavaignac had done the same at Sbéhas, a year earlier, on June 11, 1844. The Sbéhas, from the Ouled Sbih tribe, after attacking settlers and collaborators, had taken refuge in a cave under an immense cliff. After joining them, the column commanded by Cavaignac blocked the entrance with brushwood and set it on fire. This was, without question, the first gas chamber in Algeria and the prelude to the series that would follow.</p>
      <p>The total annihilation of the Algerian people had become a firm objective because nothing would then prevent the full and complete enjoyment, by European settlers, of this immense fertile territory. This is how the massacre of the Algerian population was perpetuated, particularly throughout the first forty years following the arrival of the French.</p>
      <p>For Jules Verne, "before the Anglo-Saxon race, Australians and Tasmanians have vanished, before the conquerors of the Far West the Indians of North America are fading away. One day, perhaps, the Arabs will be annihilated before French colonization: it is the law of progress."</p>
      <p>The study of the demographic evolution of this Algerian population perfectly reveals the extent of the humanitarian disaster committed. After 40 years of massacres, famine and epidemics, the Algerian population was evaluated at 2,100,000 souls, according to the first complete and official census, established in 1872 by the French authorities in Algeria. How much was it in 1830? Not having yet penetrated into the interior of the kingdom, the French evaluated it variously and the least hazardous figures varied between 3 and 4 million.</p>
      <p>On this subject, Jennifer Sessions writes: "military conquest had a devastating demographic impact on the indigenous population, which fell from 4 million on the eve of colonization to 2.3 million in the mid-1850s. She adds: "the French war undoubtedly figures in the pantheon of <em>colonial genocides</em>" <span class=citation data-cites=sessions2015sword>(Sessions 2015)</span>.</p>
      <p>A more credible evaluation, based on real knowledge of the country and on statistical research carried out throughout the Regency, with tax collectors, notables and tribes, the Algerian Hamdan Khodja<label for=sm-5 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox id=sm-5
          class=margin-toggle><span class=sidenote>Respected notable, wealthy owner and law professor at the zaouia of Algiers, he is a Kouloughli, of Turkish father and Algerian mother. He traveled extensively, both throughout Algeria and in Europe and the East. In addition to speaking Arabic and Turkish, he also learned French and English. The French invasion upset his situation. His political activity defending the natives attracted French distrust and material reprisals. Despite this, he wrote in 1833 a work "The Mirror" in which he draws up a detailed picture of the situation of the Regency of Algiers before 1830, then denounces the exactions committed by the French army. Harassed, threatened, particularly by Clauzel, he would end up reluctantly leaving Algeria to settle in Turkey, where he would end his days.</span>, dignitary, esteemed and recognized as sincere and fundamentally honest by the French themselves, wrote in 1833 in his book The Mirror: "the kingdom of Algiers is a nation of 10,000,000 souls" <span class=citation

      </figure>
      <p>From this date of 1872, a decrease in killings was noted but which was ultimately only due to an increasingly important need for more than cheap local labor because 98% of Algeria's best lands, which belonged to large tribes, ultimately ended up in the hands of the European population.</p>
      <p>Despite these multiple misdeeds, the decades that followed the capture of Algiers saw a multiplication of articles and reports from intellectual personalities who praised the heroism and honor of French soldiers, paid homage to France, which came as civilizer of a backward country and insisted on the need for France to pursue the total colonization of Algeria, in order to achieve specific objectives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Realize the dream of a renaissance and reconstruction of a colonial empire that would allow competing with England's arrogant power.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Get rid of the segment of the French population affected by poverty and demographic excess toward the colony, as well as the very high number of brigands and criminals who no longer found room in saturated French prisons.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Among the defenders of the extreme colonization of Algeria's land, we find among others, famous writers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Alexandre Dumas, enthusiastic from the announcement of the expedition, he even wanted to be part of it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Guy de Maupassant, charged by Le Gaulois to write journalistic chronicles during his various stays in Algeria and while, moreover, he claimed to disapprove of the violent form of colonization but still stating its benefits, he wrote degrading analyses for Algerians, whom he described under false aspects, with appalling morals, vile, perverse behaviors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Lamartine, poet-deputy, rather ambivalent, who on one side firmly denounced in 1846, at the national assembly, the army's violence but who would do nothing of what he advocated once in power.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The writer and deputy Victor Hugo. Author of <em>Les Misérables</em> and usually very active in French political life, he remained a passive accomplice to what was happening in Algeria, "author of more than a thousand pages of political interventions, he did not devote a single one of his speeches or articles to the Algerian question," explains Franck Laurent, lecturer in literature, in "Victor Hugo facing the conquest of Algeria."</p>
          <p>During a dinner with General Bugeaud in January 1841, he declared to him "I believe that our new conquest is a happy and great thing. It is civilization marching on barbarism. It is an enlightened people going to find a people in the night. We are the Greeks of the world." <em>Note by Adèle Hugo, his wife, which she published in 1863, in Victor Hugo, Complete Works, French Book Club, Paris, 1967-1970, volume VI.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The expedition painter Horace Vernet, who glorified in colorful paintings the dark acts of the French invaders. It is appropriate here to quote Charles Baudelaire, who had the greatness to express his disgust for this type of painting: "I hate this art improvised to the roll of the drum, these canvases daubed at a gallop, this painting manufactured with a pistol."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The highly reputed Alexis de Tocqueville, the two-faced parliamentarian-writer. Indeed recognized as a fervent defender of democracy and freedoms throughout the world, member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, he presented in 1847 a report to the national assembly, which was won over to him, where he declared "approving that houses be burned, that silos be emptied, that unarmed men, women and children be seized," means necessary according to him to establish France's domination.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Muslim religion, a strong link between Algerians, was not spared and it was described, through shameful lies, as being retrograde and obscurantist, violent, fanatical, at the base of abominations and immoral behaviors (see testimonies at the end of the article).</p>
      <p>A real brainwashing that would ultimately forge an indelible cliché and disgust for the "Arab" in the French imagination and make people admit that these "natives" and these "barbarians" only represent an "inferior race," inaccessible to civilization and whose extermination consequently becomes lawful and necessary. Petit-Jean<label for=sm-6 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox
          id=sm-6 class=margin-toggle><span class=sidenote>Book by Charles Jeannel, published in Paris in 1848, by C. Delagrave. Racist work, where Algiers is told to the child Petit-Jean, as being a den of brigands and the Arabs presented in the most abject form. Perfidious narration, which would succeed in revolting Petit-Jean, who very upset, would launch in a cry: "what a shame! why wasn't war waged to exterminate this abominable people." Shamefully pedagogical work, quite illustrated, intended for students of the Republic and widely recommended by institutions, it enjoyed great success for more than 30 years. The art of creating generations of racists despite themselves.</span>, Charles Jeannel's work, published in 1884, is the perfect illustration of this pedagogical brainwashing.</p>
      <p>Later, the surviving Algerian population, subjected to extreme misery, would additionally suffer real apartheid, through the establishment of the Code de l'indigénat (Native Code). This infamous code that removed all their civic rights, that subjected them to arbitrary individual or collective sanctions, of a physical or financial nature, that denied them the right to education by undertaking the destruction of schools and the marginalization of teachers.</p>
      <p>The Algerian thus found himself dispossessed of his land, his personality and his culture, then reduced to an "inferior being," unwelcome in his own country, a country yet described by diplomats, or by simple travelers, as a flourishing State inhabited by a largely literate people.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, who were really the Barbarians? Were they not the sinisterly notorious officers, such as Savary, Bugeaud, Pélissier, Randon, St Arnaud, Cavaignac, Lamoricière... as well as the various governments that had succeeded since 1830 and who covered them?</p>
      <p>The decades thus passed and Algeria's sky remained dark for its people, until the day when a star began to shine, then to spread its brightness over the entire country... it was in 1926, a certain North African Star<label for=sm-7 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox id=sm-7
          class=margin-toggle><span class=sidenote>The North African Star was the first Algerian nationalist party to emerge, advocating the country's independence. It was created in France in the spring of 1926, with the support of the French Communist Party. Initially, it was a charity association run by Muslim workers residing in France. Several names of Algerian militants are associated with the birth of the ENA, but that of Messali Hadj has remained its symbol.</span>.</p>

      <h2 id=sec:conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Ultimately, this French military expedition in Algeria, which claimed to be civilizing, was in reality only infamous perjury, massive looting, apartheid, genocides and crimes against Humanity, one of the bloodiest and most dishonorable episodes in French History.</p>
      <p>It is at the very least indecent that current official France which, on one side, regularly denounces the Armenian genocide and crimes committed by the Nazis, which organizes commemorations for the Holocaust and for Oradour<label for=sm-8 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox id=sm-8
          class=margin-toggle><span class=sidenote>Oradour-sur-Glane is a commune in France, located in Nouvelle-Aquitaine, where all the inhabitants, men, women and children were massacred by the Nazis on June 10, 1944, a total of 642 victims, in retaliation for their support of French resistance fighters against Vichy and Germany.</span>, persists on the other side in denying and ignoring the genocides and crimes committed in its name in Algeria for more than a century and of which certain politicians continue to praise the "benefits of colonization." Among others, a former president of France shamelessly affirmed, in a book he recently published, that the colonization of Algeria in no way constituted a crime against Humanity and even pushed cynicism to the point of qualifying it as a <em>civilizing</em>, even <em>humanitarian</em> work.</p>
      <p>One day, all the evil that was done by French colonialism will have to be recognized, mourning for these 132 years of misfortunes must take place and finally, once the page is written, it can then be turned. It is moreover incumbent upon the Algerian State the obligation to consolidate the duty of memory and perpetuate commemorations of the tragic events of the past.</p>
